# Website 2019

## Install

```
make install
```

## Generate

```
make html
```

## Deploy

The code in 2019 is the website, it's what gets generated when `make html` is called.

Either generate and commit the changes, or let the CI do it. Travis will normally deploy changes on `master`.

The site is hosted on github pages, so pushing is deploying.
